# Behind the Headlines

**Instructions:**
1. Select Two News Articles:
    
    - Find two articles from different sources that cover the same recent event or issue in the Middle East (e.g., one from a Western outlet and one from a Middle Eastern or international outlet).
2. Analysis of the First Article:
    
    - **Identify Bias:** What language or tone does the article use? Is the portrayal positive, negative, or neutral?
    - **Missing Viewpoints:** Whose voices are included? Are any perspectives missing (e.g., local populations, opposing sides, minority groups)?
    - **Emphasis and Focus:** What aspects of the story are highlighted? Are any important details downplayed or omitted?
    - **Context:** Does the article provide enough historical or cultural background to understand the situation?
3. Comparison with the Second Article:
    
    - **Tone and Language:** How does the tone or language differ between the two articles?
    - **Viewpoints and Focus:** Are different perspectives emphasized? What viewpoints are present in one article but absent in the other?
    - **Overall Coverage:** Which article gives a more balanced or complete picture of the event, and why?
4. Write Your Response:  
    In 400-600 words, summarize your findings for both articles. Compare how they portray the same event, discuss differences in bias and missing viewpoints, and reflect on how each article might shape readers’ perceptions of the Middle East.

## FAQ
#### **1. What’s the purpose of this assignment?**

The goal is to help you think more critically about how the Middle East is shown in the news. You’ll compare two news articles to see how the same event can be written about differently depending on the news source. This will help you spot bias and missing information.

#### **2. How do I choose two articles to compare?**

Pick two articles that cover the same event. It’s best to choose one from a Western news outlet (like BBC or CNN) and another from a Middle Eastern or international news source (like Al Jazeera or The National). Make sure both articles are about the same event so you can easily compare them.

#### **3. What does bias mean, and how do I find it?**

Bias is when an article leans more towards one side of the story, often in how it uses words or what it chooses to focus on. Look for:

- Whether the article is more positive, negative, or neutral about the event.
- If it tells both sides of the story or just one.
- Whether it includes important background information to help the reader understand.

#### **4. What should I do if my two articles are too similar?**

If the articles seem almost the same, look for small differences:

- How do the authors describe the event or the people involved?
- What details are focused on more in one article compared to the other?
- You might want to choose different articles if there’s no clear difference.

#### **5. How do I find missing viewpoints?**

Think about who is affected by the event in the article. Are those people quoted or included? For example, if the article talks about a protest, are the protesters' voices included, or just government officials? Look for any group that seems important to the story but isn’t mentioned.

#### **6. Can I use opinion articles for this assignment?**

It’s better to use regular news articles that report facts. Opinion pieces can be too one-sided, making it harder to compare fairly. Stick with factual news reports for this assignment.

#### **7. What if I have trouble finding articles to compare?**

Try searching on different news websites, using the event’s name or other keywords related to the topic. Look for both Western and international sources to get a good variety.

#### **8. How should I organize my analysis?**

Your response should include:

1. A short summary of what happened (covered in both articles).
2. An analysis of the bias, missing viewpoints, and differences in tone or focus between the articles.
3. A reflection on how these differences affect how we understand the event.

Keep your response between 400-600 words and make sure to include all these points.

#### **9. What’s the biggest mistake to avoid?**

The most common mistake is just summarizing the articles without comparing or analyzing them. Make sure you focus on finding bias and missing viewpoints, not just telling me what each article says.

#### **10. How can I get a better grade on this assignment?**

- Choose articles that are different enough to give you something to compare.
- Look for both obvious and small differences in how the articles present the event.
- Show that you understand how these differences might change how people view the Middle East.
- Make sure your response is clear, organized, and includes the right key terms.

#### **11. Can I use articles in another language?**

Yes, but your final written analysis needs to be in English. If you pick an article in a different language, make sure you understand it well and can explain it clearly in English.

#### **12. How do I include my sources?**

At the end of your response, write the titles, authors, and the news outlets you used for your articles. Make sure it’s easy to find where your information came from.
